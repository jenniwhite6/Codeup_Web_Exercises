FORMS
Why two forms in one html page?
How do I make both forms submit, without just putting all of the content within one form?
Can you submit form information without a send or submit button? (e.g. I just have a basic select form, and I select yes or no - how do I actually perform the GET request?)
LABEL
Q: "label for" is not used with radio buttons or checkboxes - why??? My guess: because there are multiple checkboxes, all with different ids / because there are no ids on radio buttons, it would be redundant/unnecessary, since the label tag can just wrap the radio input tag.
Q: Why no ids for radio buttons, while checkboxes have one for each option? My guess: multiple ids for checkboxes because you can have multiple answers, whereas the radio buttons allow you to select only one choice.
Q: My multiple select box looks ugly - is that how it's supposed to be formatted, or should I add some <p> tags to put the question on a separate line?

Remember, an element ID is UNIQUE!!! Points to ONE element only. [# - id selector]
An element CLASS can point to a whole group of elements. [. - class selector]
